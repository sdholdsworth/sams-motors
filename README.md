A Fully Responsive, Robust &amp; Stylish Car Sales React JS Application

Now that I have built up my ES6+ vanilla JavaScript skills and hit the ground running with it having worked on a few ES6 vanilla JavaScript projects... the time has come for me to start my React JavaScript development journey.

In this, my very first proper React JS project, I am going to combine the skills I have gained in the past with the theoretical and practical knowledge I have gained through completing my React JS course on Udemy.

The project will be front-end focused and will consist of a well themed modern UI design that will be fully response across a range of devices.

The main aspect and learning element for me on this project is of course React JS. However, as I am going to be coupling this project with several other technologies, the project will also help me continue to build on my design and project planning skills, ES6 vanilla JS, JSON data handling, HTML, CSS, Sass, Babel, Webpack and GIT skills.
