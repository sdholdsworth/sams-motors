# Sam's Motors
A Fully Responsive, Robust &amp; Stylish Car Sales React JS Application

The project will be front-end focused and will consist of a well themed modern UI design that will be fully response across a range of devices.

The main aspect and learning element for me on this project is of course React JS. However, as I am going to be coupling this project with several other technologies, the project will also help me continue to build on my design and project planning skills, ES6 vanilla JS, JSON data handling, HTML, CSS, Sass, Babel, Webpack and GIT skills.
